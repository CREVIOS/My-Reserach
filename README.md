#### A Novel Approach in Automated Bengali Text summarizing by Statistical and Sentence Similarity Method

##### Abstract
The  world  is  now  moving  in  faster  speed  with  the  blessings  of technology. Vast amounts of information today are stored in the cloud instead of hard copy documents or compact disk. Hence, to keep    information    shortly    and    concisely    in    the    cloud, summarization of informationcould be an efficient choice. Doing manual summarization is a tedious task and hence data scientists are  thinking  of  an  automated  process  that  provides  a  near-human/human   quality   summary.   In   this   paper,   the   author attempts   to   perform   automated   summarization   on   several sample input texts with two algorithms-statistical and sentence similarity  approach.  The  first  approach  returns  the  summary based  on  the  frequency  of  word  appearances  processing  the probability theory while the second figures out the similarity of sentences based on python NLTK corpora and WordNet modules. While  testing  several  inputs, author  observes  that  the  sentence similarity approach gives a much better result than the statistical approach   although   it   needs   slightly   more   time.   Therefore, sentence similarity could be considered as the best approach of automatic text summarization than statistical approach. Besides, in this paper, author chooses python as a programming language considering   its   various   advantages   like   having   open-source NLTK library, Brown Corpus and WordNet database, integration properties etc.
